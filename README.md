# monstor is a project about a monstor figure that has tentacles and can be controlled by the mouse to whichever direction you indicate to. It is coded in HTML, CSS and Javascript. The Javascript document creates a visually appealing and interactive animation of tentacles that follows a moving mouse movement on the HTML page. But even if there is no mouse controlling its direction it can move by itself.
